## What I learned

- JSX is just syntactic sugar
- `React.createElement`
- Virtual DOM mental model
- Why components are just functions
- Why re-renders happen
- How `useState` triggers re-render
- Parent re-render → Child re-render
- Why React doesn’t "diff smartly" by default
- Props drilling mechanics
- Why passing functions down causes re-renders
- Why large apps suffer from this
- Functions are recreated on every render
- Objects break memoization
- Why React compares by reference
- `React.memo`
- `useCallback`
- When memoization actually works
- When it’s useless
- Flamegraph reading
- Commit phase vs render phase
- Measuring real cost
- Lifting state vs local state
- When to split components
- When to use Context
- When NOT to use memoization

## What confused me

## What I avoided
