# Week 2

## What I built

## What I learned

- Browser does NOT think in “pages”. It thinks in **resources**.

- HTML is parsed **top to bottom** & each tag becomes a **node**

- HTML -> DOM; CSS -> CSSOM _(parsing)_

- Modern browsers split page into **layers**.

- Browser renders **trees**, not files

## What confused me

## What I avoided

## What I will do next week
