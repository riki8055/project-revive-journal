# Week 7

## What I built

## What I learned

- How the browser actually works:
  - HTML → DOM
  - CSS → CSSOM
  - DOM + CSSOM → Render Tree
  - Layout → Paint → Composite

- Difference between:
  - Reflow (layout) → expensive, cascading
  - Repaint → visual only, cheaper but frequent

## What confused me

## What I avoided

## What I will do next week
