# Week 2

## What I built

<a href="https://github.com/riki8055/project-revive-journal/tree/main/weekly-projects%2F2-vanilla-js-form-system">Vanilla JS Form System</a>

## What I learned

- Browser does NOT think in “pages”. It thinks in **resources**.

- HTML is parsed **top to bottom** & each tag becomes a **node**

- HTML -> DOM; CSS -> CSSOM _(parsing)_

- Modern browsers split page into **layers**.

- Browser renders **trees**, not files

- DOM is not HTML. DOM lives in memory

- JS manipulates nodes, not strings

- Writes can trigger rendering

- Layout is expensive

- innerHTML destroys state

- Events flow through DOM

- Performance = fewer mutations

- (d4) Forms are browser-native

- Validation happens before HTTP

- Failed validation = no request

- `name` controls serialization

- Client validation ≠ security

- Server validation is final

- Status codes communicate failure

## What confused me

- Nothing

## What I avoided

- Nothing
