# Week 7

## What I built

## What I learned

- How the browser actually works:
  - HTML → DOM
  - CSS → CSSOM
  - DOM + CSSOM → Render Tree
  - Layout → Paint → Composite

- Difference between:
  - Reflow (layout) → expensive, cascading
  - Repaint → visual only, cheaper but frequent

- Why JS blocks rendering
- What “Main Thread” actually does
- Script loading strategies:
    - `defer`
    - `async`
- Cost of:
    - Long loops
    - Heavy JSON parsing
    - Synchronous event handlers
